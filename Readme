# SERVESAGE  
*The wisdom behind your service operations.*  

---

## 🚀 What is SERVESAGE?  
SERVESAGE is an intelligent analytics and forecasting platform designed to **extend ServiceTitan’s capabilities**.  
We help service companies transform raw operational data into **actionable insights** that improve technician performance, customer experience, and long-term growth.  

Think of SERVESAGE as the **missing intelligence layer** on top of your existing ServiceTitan data.

## 🎯 Why SERVESAGE?  
ServiceTitan gives you the data. SERVESAGE gives you the clarity.  

- Too many reports, not enough insight.  
- Hard to measure **technician performance** beyond basic metrics.  
- Forecasting demand is often reactive, not predictive.  
- Managers spend hours piecing together dashboards instead of making decisions.  

SERVESAGE solves this.
